# Handling multiple large files the easy way using Python
###### Workshop Instructor: Laura Gutierrez Funderburk | Department of Mathematics | Simon Fraser University

###### Workshop date: April 24 2018

## Abstract

In this repository, I will walk through a series of exercises whose purpose is to make the process of handling multiuple files easier via the use of Python dictionaries, tables and comprehension lists. I will provide an example, files and a series of commands for participants to explore. Throughout this workhops and for pedagogical purposes, I will be using Jupyter notebooks. 

## Prep

### IMPORTANT: 

If you have an SFU login account, you can skip installing Python and simply access one of [SFU's Jupyter servers](https://sfu.syzygy.ca/)

### Otherwise...

Ensure you have installed Python on your local computer. Throughout these exercises, I will be using Python 3.6. One of the easiest ways to install Python on your local computer is by downloading and installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux). I strongly recommend installing Anaconda as it includes Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas and other scientific packages that will be used throughout this workshop. 

### Documentation
